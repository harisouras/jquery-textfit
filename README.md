#jQuery TextFit

TextFit is a jQuery plugin that automatically resizes HTML `textarea` elements to fit their content.

##Requirements

* [jQuery](http://jquery.com)
* [ZURB's Text Change Event Plugin](http://www.zurb.com/playground/jquery-text-change-custom-event)

**Please note:** TextFit will work just fine without the text change event, however the content will only fit when jQuery's built in 'change' event is triggered.

##Installation

Copy the TextFit file (either the uncompressed or the minified one) to your resources directory and then simply link to the file in your HTML document.

```html
<script src="jquery-textfit.js" type="text/javascript"></script>
```

To get up and running quickly, you can set TextFit to automatically match all `textarea` elements within the document by adding "?auto" to the end of the `script` element's `src` attribute.

```html
<script src="jquery-textfit.js?auto" type="text/javascript"></script>
```

##Using TextFit

To run TextFit, simply run the function on any `textarea` elements matched with jQuery, like so:

```javascript
$('textarea').textfit();
```

You can limit the height of a textarea using CSS, simply by setting the `max-height` rule.

```css
textarea {
    max-height: 300px;
}
```
